    <h2>Super Easy Lasagna</h2> 
<p>Lasagna is the super easy comfort food.</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<div>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Box oven ready lasagna noodles(8oz is fine)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil or avocado oil</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef</li>
        <li>1 medium white onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 (32oz to 45oz) jar of spaghetti sauce (or homemade is better of course! I like the Prego Mushroom.)</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package plain cottage cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound mozzarella cheese, shredded or grated</li>
    </ul>
</div>
 
<h2>Directions</h2>
<div>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large skillet or saucepan, heat the oil on medium then add the diced onions. Cook for 5-10 minutes or until they start getting translucent. Pour onions into a separate dish while the meat cooks (so they don't burn).</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, add ground beef and break up into little pieces. Cook until browned, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add onions back to the hamburger. Pour in the entire jar of spaghetti sauce. Simmer for 10-20 minutes</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350.</li>
        <li>Layer the following in the baking pan: a single layer of uncooked noodles, 1/3 of the sauce, 1/3 of the cottage cheese, 1/3 of the mozzarella. Repeat two more times, ending with mozzarella on the top. For each layer just spread the stuff out as best you can, no need to be perfectly even.</li>
        <li>Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, and let cool for 10 minutes before serving to keep the meat nice and juicy.</li>    
    </ol>
